## 🧑‍💻 About the Developer

I'm **Fahad**, a computer engineer from Saudi Arabia.  
I built this project out of a real need — organizing casual football tournaments with friends was always messy (WhatsApp, papers, lost results... you name it).

So I decided to create something simple, beautiful, and accessible to everyone —  
no login, no accounts, just pure organization — **Dorina Pro** 💪
